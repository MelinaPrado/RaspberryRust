# Dissecting Late Leaf Rust Resistance in Raspberries

## Overview

This repository contains the supplementary data files associated with the manuscript titled **"Complementary approaches to dissect late leaf rust resistance in an interspecific raspberry population"** by Prado, M.; Vieira da Silva, A.; RomÃªro Campos, G.; Lima Reis Borges, K.; Massahiro Yassue, R.; Husein, G.; Akens, F.F.; Sposito, M.B.; Amorim, L.; Behrouzi, P.; Bustos-Korts, D.; & Fritsche-Neto, R. (2024). 
These data files are essential for understanding the genetic architecture controlling resistance to late leaf rust in raspberries, as detailed in the study.
